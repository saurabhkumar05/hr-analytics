## Data Analysis using Excel
Excel was used for data analysis, including cleaning, organizing, and summarizing the employee data. Various Excel functions and tools were utilized to perform calculations and generate insights from the dataset.
## Data Cleaning
The dataset was cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, correcting errors, and handling missing values. Data formatting was also applied to make the dataset suitable for analysis. In my case data was pre cleaned so i did not had to to much.
## Build Dashboard
A dashboard was created in Excel to visualize key HR metrics and insights. The dashboard includes KPIs such as total employees, attrition, active employees, attrition rate, and average age. Additionally, various charts were included to visualize data, such as total employees by gender, education-wise attrition, attrition by job role, department-wise attrition, attrition by age group, and attrition by marital status.
